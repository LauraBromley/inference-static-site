# Penguin Identifier Front End

This is the front end website for a [Penguin Identifier](https://patagoniapenguins.org/which-penguin) application. It is written using knockout.js with bootstrap for styling.

Images of penguins can be uploaded and the application uses machine learning to predict the penguin species.

The server side code is deployed on an Amazon Web Services Lambda function, and can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/LauraBromley/penguin-inference-api).
